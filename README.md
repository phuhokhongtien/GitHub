## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The CI/CD pipeline automatically:

- **For Pull Requests:**
  - Runs code linting and formatting checks
  - Performs TypeScript type checking
  - Executes unit tests with coverage reporting
  - Reports coverage to Codecov

- **For Main/Develop Branch:**
  - All PR checks plus:
  - Builds Android APK and iOS archives (mobile)
  - Builds and pushes Docker images (backend)
  - Uploads build artifacts
