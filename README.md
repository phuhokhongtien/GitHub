## CI/CD Pipeline

Our CI/CD pipeline automatically:
- ✅ Runs linters and type checks on all PRs
- ✅ Executes unit and integration tests
- ✅ Builds Android APK and iOS apps
- ✅ Generates Docker images for backend
- ✅ Uploads test coverage to Codecov
- ✅ Deploys to production on merge to main
- ✅ Publishes mobile apps on tagged releases

See the [CI/CD documentation](docs/ci-cd.md) for more details.

## Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `develop`
2. Make your changes with tests
3. Push and create a Pull Request
4. Wait for automated CI checks to pass
5. Get code review approval
6. Merge to `develop`
7. Create PR to `main` for production deployment

## Testing

Run tests for both mobile and backend:

```bash
# Mobile
cd mobile && npm test

# Backend
cd backend && npm test
cd backend && npm run test:integration
```
