./demo.sh

# Open browser to http://localhost:8000/src/analytics/ui/dashboard.html
# Enable analytics when prompted
# View real-time metrics and insights
```

### For Developers
```javascript
// Initialize service
const service = new AnalyticsService();
service.initialize();

// Enable analytics for user
service.setUserConsent('user-id', 'tenant-id', true);

// Collect metrics
service.collectMetric(new UsageMetric('tenant-id', 'user-id', 'action', 100));

// Get statistics
const stats = service.getAggregatedStats('tenant-id');
```
