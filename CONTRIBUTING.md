## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code
- Ensure all functions and components have **proper type annotations**
- Avoid using `any` type - use `unknown` or proper types instead
- Use **interfaces** for object shapes and **types** for unions/intersections

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Use **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code formatting
- Run `npm run lint` to check for issues
- Use **meaningful variable and function names**
- Keep functions **small and focused** (single responsibility)
- Add **comments** for complex logic

### React Native / React

- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Keep components **small and reusable**
- Use **proper prop types** with TypeScript interfaces
- Implement **proper error handling**
- Follow React best practices and hooks rules

### File Organization

- Place components in `src/components/`
- Place screens in `src/screens/`
- Place utilities in `src/utils/`
- Place types in `src/types/`
- Use **index files** for clean imports

## üìè Commit Guidelines

### Types

- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Performance improvement
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
