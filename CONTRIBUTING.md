### Suggesting Features

We welcome feature suggestions! Before creating a feature request:

1. Check the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) to see if it's already planned
2. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
3. Consider if the feature aligns with project goals

When creating a feature request, include:

- **Clear title**: Briefly describe the feature

- **Alternatives**: Other solutions you've considered
- **Additional context**: Mockups, examples, etc.

**Use the `enhancement` label for feature requests.**

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:

- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `fix/bug-description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/documentation-update` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/component-name` - Code refactoring
- `test/test-description` - Test additions or modifications

### Commit Message Guidelines

Write clear, concise commit messages:

**Format:**
```
type(scope): subject

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions or changes
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

**Examples:**
```
feat(voice): add wake word detection

fix(auth): resolve token expiration issue
