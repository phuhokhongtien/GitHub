## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code
- Define proper **types and interfaces** for all data structures
- Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use **meaningful variable and function names**
- Keep functions **small and focused**

### Code Formatting

- Use **2 spaces** for indentation
- Use **single quotes** for strings
- Add **semicolons** at the end of statements
- Keep line length under **100 characters** when possible
- Use **trailing commas** in multi-line objects and arrays

### Component Guidelines

```typescript
// Use functional components with hooks
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

interface MyComponentProps {
  title: string;
  onPress?: () => void;
}

export const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ title, onPress }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState<string>('');

  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect logic
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>{title}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 16,
  },
});
```

### File Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx`)
- **Utilities**: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
- **Screens**: PascalCase (e.g., `HomeScreen.tsx`)
- **Types**: PascalCase (e.g., `UserTypes.ts`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE in files (e.g., `API_CONSTANTS.ts`)

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Performance improvement
