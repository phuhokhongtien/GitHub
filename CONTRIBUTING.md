# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the GitHub Out-Sourcing project! ðŸŽ‰

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your development environment**
   - Follow the [Quick Start Guide](./docs/QUICK-START.md) for a 5-minute setup
   - Or see the [Development Setup Guide](./docs/dev-setup.md) for detailed instructions

2. **Familiarize yourself with the codebase**
   - Review the project structure in [README.md](./README.md)
   - Explore the backend and app directories

3. **Check existing issues**
   - Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
   - Comment on the issue you want to work on

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow existing code style
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep changes focused and atomic

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm test

# Test both backend and app
npm run test:backend
npm run test:app
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"
# or
git commit -m "fix: resolve login redirect issue"
```

Commit message format:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:
- Clear title describing the change
- Description of what changed and why
- Reference to related issues (e.g., "Closes #123")
- Screenshots for UI changes

## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Use meaningful variable names
- Follow ESLint rules (will auto-fix on save in VS Code)

### React/React Native

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful component names
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

### Backend

- Use async/await instead of callbacks
- Handle errors properly
- Validate input data
- Write descriptive API documentation

## Pull Request Guidelines
