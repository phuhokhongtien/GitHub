# Architecture Overview

## Project Structure

The Kendy MCP Assistant follows a modular architecture designed for scalability and maintainability.

### Directory Structure

```

├── components/      # Reusable UI components
├── screens/        # Screen components
├── navigation/     # Navigation configuration
├── services/       # API and external services
├── utils/          # Utility functions
├── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
└── assets/         # Static resources
```

## Component Architecture

### Component Types

1. **Screen Components**: Full-page components that represent app screens
2. **UI Components**: Reusable UI elements (buttons, inputs, cards)
3. **Container Components**: Logic-heavy components that manage state
4. **Presentational Components**: Pure components focused on rendering

### State Management

- Local component state using React Hooks (`useState`, `useReducer`)
- Context API for shared state across components
- Future: Consider Redux or Zustand for complex state management

## Navigation

Using React Navigation for screen navigation:
- Stack Navigator for hierarchical navigation
- Tab Navigator for bottom tab navigation
- Drawer Navigator for side menu (if needed)

## API Integration

### Service Layer

All API calls are abstracted in the `services/` directory:
- Centralized API configuration
- Error handling
- Request/response interceptors
- Type-safe API responses

## Type Safety

TypeScript is used throughout the project:
- Type definitions in `src/types/`
- Interface definitions for props
- Strict type checking enabled

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for utilities and services
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Integration tests for user flows
- E2E tests with Detox (future)

## Performance Optimization

- Lazy loading of screens
- Memoization with `useMemo` and `useCallback`
- Image optimization
- List virtualization with `FlatList`

## Security Considerations

- Secure storage for sensitive data
- API key management
- Input validation
- Secure communication (HTTPS)
